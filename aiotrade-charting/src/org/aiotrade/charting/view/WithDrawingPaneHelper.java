/**
 * This class help to implement a default drawingPart support.

 * @author Caoyuan Deng
 * @TIPS As Java does not support multi-inheriting, here shows a good solution, example:
 * QuoteChartView, which has been a sub-class of ChartView, but want some
 * Default drawing feature too. It implement WithDrawingPane interface via this
 * cookie. Actually, that is something like inhertied from ChartView and
 * WithDrawingPaneHelper.
