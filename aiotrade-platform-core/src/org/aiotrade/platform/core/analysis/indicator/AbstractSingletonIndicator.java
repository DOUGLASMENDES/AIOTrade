 * Usually, indicator instances are created by call createNewInstance(),
 * But in this class, createNewInstance() don't really create a new singletonInstance,
 * it just return the singletonInstance.
 * 
 * Here is not the traditional singleton pattern, which implement singleton by 
 * using <em>private</em> constructor and a static getInstance() method. This is
 * because that, in many cases (such as NetBeans FileSystem, or serializtion etc.), 
 * a <em>public</em> constructor with empty args is required.
