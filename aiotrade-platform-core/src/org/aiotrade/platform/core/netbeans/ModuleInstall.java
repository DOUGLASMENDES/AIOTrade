/**
 * How do i change the closing action of the MainWindow?
 * http://platform.netbeans.org/faqs/actions-how-to-add-actions-to-fi.html#DevFaqMainwindowClosingAction
 *
 * When you click the close button in the top right corner the application closes. 
 * If you want to do something before the application closes (eg. a dialog with 
 * ok and cancel options) or prevent it from closing , you'll have to override 
 * the org.openide.modules.ModuleInstall class.
 *
 * Make a class in your module that extends the org.openide.modules.ModuleInstall
 * class and override the closing() method. Keep in mind that setting the return
 * value of this method to "true" means the application will not be able to close
 * at all.
 * 
 * Next you have to tell your module to load this new class by adding a reference
 * to your Manifest file : e.g. 
 * "OpenIDE-Module-Install: org/netbeans/modules/java/JavaModule.class" 
 * where "JavaModule.class" should be the name of your class.
