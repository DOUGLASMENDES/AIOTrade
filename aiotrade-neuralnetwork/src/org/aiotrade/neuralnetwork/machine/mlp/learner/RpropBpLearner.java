/**
 * Resilient Backpropagation (RPROP) algorithm
 *
 * Each weight has its own individual update-value (delta_ij(t)) represented
 * by the next object.
 *
 * The weight update deltaW_ij(t) is defined as follows (dE(t) / dW_ij is the
 * summed gradient for a single epoch):
 *                | -delta_ij(t), if dE(t) / dW_ij > 0
 * deltaW_ij(t) = |  delta_ij(t), if dE(t) / dW_ij < 0
 *                |  0            otherwise
 *
 * The delta_ij values are updated as follows:
 *               | learningRatePlus  * delta_ij(t-1), if dE(t-1)/ dW_ij * dE(t)/ dW_ij > 0
 * delta_ij(t) = | learningRateMinus * delta_ij(t-1), if dE(t-1)/ dW_ij * dE(t)/ dW_ij < 0
 *               | delta_ij(t-1),                     otherwise
 *
 * where 0 < learningRateMinus < 1 < learningRatePlus
 *
 * The learningRatePlus  usally set to 1.2
 * The learningRateMinus usally set to 0.5
